#### Year-to-Year Cluster Analysis

In addition to seasonal clustering, a year-to-year comparison of replicate sampling sites was analyzed with cluster analysis to compare the reproducibility of previous grouping patterns to each other. The results of this analysis were inconclusive due to limitations of the data collection and modeling techniques used. A standardized sampling system and timescale would be needed to properly control confounding variables to utlize this type of analysis. A detailed description of these methods and exploratory figures can be found in the written commentary for the ```Unsepervised_Learning_Analysis``` script in the ```code``` folder and ```analysis_code``` subfolder.
