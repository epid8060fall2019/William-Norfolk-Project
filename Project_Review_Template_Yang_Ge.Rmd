Hello William.

Well done. Because I don't know Ecology, so mainly comment on the format. Here are my comments.

1. The title of Figure 1 was not right.

2. Because your figure results may have round number issue, violin plots may not better then boxplot. I think due to that, your violin plots have weird shape.

3. I didn't find some test on results, I thought:
â€œQuestion 4: Citizen Science Data Efficacy
Is citizen science data accurate enough to capture large-scale environmental trends and is the data specific enough to characterize different aquatic habitat types."
This question could have some test and p-value on the comparison.

4. Cannot find methods about Citizen Science Data. Who by how collected the data? is there any difference on equipment used?
